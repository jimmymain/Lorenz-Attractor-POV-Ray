Available for download here: \r\nhttp://www.povray.org/\r\n\r\nThe Lorenz attractor is a simplified model of convection of a gas within a confined space. This very simple model results in some very interesting motion, an example of deterministic chaos. \r\nA chaotic system is very sensitive to initial conditions and the system rapidly diverges. \r\n\r\nThe system is described by three coupled non-linear differential equations:\r\n\r\ndx / dt = a (y - x)\r\n\r\ndy / dt = x (b - z) - y\r\n\r\ndz / dt = xy - cz\r\n\r\nwhere a is the *Prandtl number* representing ratio of fluid viscosity to thermal conductivity\r\nb is the *Rayleigh number* representing the difference in temperature between the top and bottom of the box\r\nc is the ratio of the width to height of the box\r\n\r\nCommonly used constants are a = 10, b = 28 and c = 8/3.\r\n\r\nThis repository contains the POV-Ray code for rendering the Lorenz attractor, and producing an animation of the attractor building up over time to show the chaotic behaviour.\r\n\r\n\r\nA video of the rendered animation can be found here (the video has a much slower, smoother framerate than the gif below):\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBTiyolNGfw\r\n\r\n![gif](http://i.imgur.com/yGYRkQ1.gif)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
